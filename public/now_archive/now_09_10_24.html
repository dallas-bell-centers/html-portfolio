        <h2>Professional Development</h2>
        <p>The fact that this site exists is a testament to my enduring interest in web development.
            Since I made my first website as a class project in high school, I've wanted to make a living out of it.
            After getting a few full-time jobs, web-development went on the back burner. Now, I'm commited to learning with the ultimate goal being to become a professional developer.
        </p>
        <p><b>Here's what I'm doing to succeed:</b> <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Studying!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm currently taking a Udemy course by Dr. Angela Yu from The App Brewery in London. <br />
                        The title of the course is "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" and it is advertised as 
                         following the same in-person curriculum as their in-person bootcamp. Overall I am enjoying the course so far, and learning a lot.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <br />
                <li>Practicing!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This site is my practice space. It will continuously be updated as I learn to implement new techniques, and hopefully soon, some styling!
                     Once I have completed my course, this site will serve as my portfolio, and I will continue to update it with my work.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I have always enjoyed video games, and lately I've been playing <i>College Football 25</i> and <i>Minecraft</i>.
            On the <i>Minecraft</i> front, I spent last week setting up a ProxMox VE server to host my own game server. I loaded up an Ubuntu server VM, and was able to transfer the files from the cloud provider I was using to my local server, meaning no lost progress!
            This was incredibly satisfying to set up and get working, and I look forward to doing more with ProxMox and homelabbing in the future.
        </p>
        <p> I've also recently taken up drawing. I've always admired people with the skill to draw, and I finally decided to commit some time to learning.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here are a few of the drawings I've done so far:
