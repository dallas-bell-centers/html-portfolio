<h1>The Best Movies Accoring to Dallas</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Sandlot</h3>
<p>
  Honestly a classic. Summertime, baseball, going to the pool, being at the fair
  with your friends, and getting into stuff you shouldn't. What's not to like?
</p>
<h3>Deadpool and Wolverine</h3>
<p>
  Another killer Marvel movie. Ryan Reynolds has really built Deadpool into a
  staple of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Also, Hugh Jackman in the Wolverine
  suit? C'mon.
</p>
<h3>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi</h3>
<p>
  Honestly this movie was fine, not my favorite but I've can't remember any
  other movies I've seen. Like ever.
