            This week I continued to learn about CSS and introduced some more styling to the site. I also played around with
            <a href = "https://www.figma.com">figma</a> as a design tool, and it has really helped me to be able to see the layout I want without having to build it in HTML.
            <br />
            Here are this week's notable updates to the site:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Archived last week's "What I'm Doing Now" page.</li>
            <li>Implemented div containers to standardize styling across the site. This is still a work in progress, but I'm liking the direction it's going.</li>
            <li>Added header and footer areas.</li>
        </ul>

            This week, my wife and I attended our local Hispanic Heritage Festival. We had a great time learning about the culture and enjoying the food.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here is a photo I took of one of the performers:

        Other news on the home front includes ordering some Ubiquiti Unifi equipment to revamp our home network. The devices should arrive early this week.
        I hope to report success in setting up the new equipment in my next update.
