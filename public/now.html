    <h2>Professional Development</h2>
    <p>
        This was a slow week for professional development. I worked on coursework for about an hour, completing a few assignments and finally adding some poor CSS to this portfolio site.
        <br />
        Here are the notable updates to the site:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Added a font from <a href = "https://fonts.google.com">https://fonts.google.com</a> which should allow all visitors to see the custom font regardless of device or browser.</li>
        <li>Began implementation of a color scheme from <a href = "https://colorhunt.co">https://colorhunt.co</a> to give the site some life. Not sold on the scheme yet.</li>
        <li> Updated this page, and implemented an archive page to keep track of all previous updates to the "Now" page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        No new drawings to share this week, I spent a lot of time playing <i>Minecraft.</i> This past weekend I also celebrated my birthday and broke out some board games to play with the family.
        Other than that, nothing truly noteworthy on the hobby front.
